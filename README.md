# Phos - 基于计算光学的胶片模拟

你说的对，但是 Phos. 是基于「计算光学」概念的胶片模拟。
通过计算光在底片上的行为，复现自然、柔美、立体的胶片质感。

这是一个原理验证demo，图像处理部分基于opencv，交互基于
streamlit平台制作，部分代码使用了AI辅助生成。

如果您发现了项目中的问题，或是有更好的想法想要分享，还请
通过邮箱 lyco_p@163.com 与我联系，我将不胜感激。

Hello! Phos. is a film simulation app based on 
the idea of "Computational optical imaging“. 
By calculating the optical effects on the film,
we could recurrent the natural, soft, and elegant
tone of these classical films.

This is a demo for idea testing. The image processing
part is based on OpenCV, and the interaction is built
on the Streamlit platform. Some of the code was
generated with the assistance of AI.

If you find any issues in the project or have better
ideas you would like to share, please contact me via
email at lyco_p@163.com. I would be very grateful.
